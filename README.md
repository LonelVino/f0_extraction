A Synthetical project with kinds of methods of fundamental frequency extraction, with YIN. SWIPE. CREPE, SPICE.

- **YIN** (Signal Processing, Time Domain)
- **SWIPE** (Signal Processing, Frequency Domain)
- **CREPE**  (Machine Learning, Time Domain, Supervision)
- **Spice** (Machine Learning, Frequency Domain, Self-Supervision)

## Preview
The pitch is one of the three major properties of the sound (volume, sound, tone, tone). And the pitch is determined by the Fundamental Frequency $f_0$.

**Pitch Estimation** (fundamental frequency extraction) has a wide range of applications in sound processing. Typically we first puts the signal into fragment, and then extracts $f_0$ frame by frame.

The method of extracting can be generally divided into **time domain method** and **frequency domain method**:

- Time domain method: The input is the waveform of sound; The basic  principle is to find the **minimum positive cycle** of waveforms.
- Frequency domain method: First perform <u>Fourier transform</u> to obtain a spectrum of signal (with amplitude spectrum, discard the phase spectrum). There will be spikes at $f_0$ in the spectrum, so the basic principle is to require the **greatest common divisor** of these spikes.
