# YIN

## Description

Fast Python implementation of the Yin algorithm: a fundamental frequency estimator.

The sampling schema is as following:
![YIN_sampling](/assets/img/YIN_sampling.png)

## Usage

```bash
python yin.py
```

All parameters (i.e frequence min, frequence max, harmonic threshold) in the yin.py function should be adapted to obtain good results. See the article \[1\] for more details.

All the functions in the code correspond to steps in the article \[1\]. Meanwhile, the difference function has been modify substantially in order to improve speed. Finally, speed has been improved by more than 1000x.

Previous works on the implementation of the YIN algorithm have been made thanks to Robin Larvor, Maxime Le Coz and Lionel Koenig.
