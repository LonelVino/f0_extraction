## Fundamental Frequencies Extraction

### Performance Measurement

How many frames on the number of total frames of the sound find the good $f_0$ (in percent)?

First we need to define what is a good $f_0$

### Further Analysis

#### DETECTION OF THE TEMPO (Black / White / Round)

#### Vibrato Analysis (FR Equency and Amplitude)


## Process the Crossing of 2 Sinuses 

### Overview

- **Methods**: Non-parammetric methods (FFT) and the methods of param.
- **Signals**: "cross.wav".
- **Objetive**: Process the intersection adapting to the signal:
    - Detection of the two sinuses, if possible all along the signal; 
    - Determine for **how many frames** for the 2 types of methods of spectral analysis can not have a goodBeetle the 2 sinuses; 
    - Consider the follow-up of Sinuso Ìˆideas: From a frame to the next one, it must be noted <u>which peak to match at which peak</u> (use only the frequencies to do this may not be sufficient)


## Write the content of the "myson.wav" 

CE signal in terms of "signal processing" and in terms of "sound collection". Both will be very different from each other.You have to deliver the thing.
